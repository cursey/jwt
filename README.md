JWT in C++

Uses [nlohmann's json library](https://github.com/nlohmann/json), [tplgy's cppcodec library](https://github.com/tplgy/cppcodec) and OpenSSL (not included). 
Only does sign verification. Other forms of JWT verification should be done yourself (which is easy because nlohmann's json library is awesome).
